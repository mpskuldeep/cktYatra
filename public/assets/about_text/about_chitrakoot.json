Chitrakoot is a town with strong spiritual overtones for the Hindus who connect the town with Lord
                    Rama.
                    All the year round there are festivals related to Lord Rama. October and November is the period of
                    Navratri festival with the popular Dussehra celebrations.
                    There is Diwali that follows in a grand manner. Then in January you have the Makar Sankranti
                    when the festival of harvest is celebrated by thanking the Sun for a good bounty.
                    There is kite flying on and around this day.
                    This is followed by Mahashivratri and the Ramayan Mela which goes on for a whole week.
